# Export with Docker

Scripts and configs contributed by [humphd](https://github.com/humphd) for automating model exports using docker.

You need a working docker setup for this to work.

Run this:

    ./docker-convert-to-onnx.sh

Once complete, there is a 'models' directory within this directory which has the source megadetector models as well
as the exported onnx models.
